The plugin requires that you have gitflow installed, specifically the [AVH edition](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow). This is because the [Vanilla Git Flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) hasn't been maintained in years

**How to check Git Flow version**

run `git flow version` 

If it says `0.4.1` then you have the wrong version. You will have to uninstall it and then refer to [AVH edition](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow) docs for installation. 


**How to uninstall wrong version on OSX**

If installed via `brew` then run `brew uninstall git-flow`                                            


**Mac/Linux users:**

If you're running into issues like getting
`Gitflow is not installed`
or
`git: 'flow' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.`
